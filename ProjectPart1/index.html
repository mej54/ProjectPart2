          <p>
            I am a senior bioinformatics major at the University of Pittsburgh, with a minor in chemistry.
          </p>

          <p>
            I am interested in applying my computational skills and molecular biology knowledge to solve the molecular mechanisms behind disease and contribute to the development of personalized medicine. Specifically, I am interested in classifying cancers and identifying potential targets for drug treatment. I have had experience in a range of biomedical informatics labs at the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, and Mt. Sinai Icahn School of Medicine. 
          </p>

          <p>
            My main projects thus far have focused on identifying head and neck cancer subtypes based on the presence of Human Papillomavirus and genetic expression patterns, and looking at the structural features of mutations in the cancer landscape. Both projects have dealt with parsing and analyzing large datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the Catalogue of Somatic Missense Mutations.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I am working with Dr. James Pipas in the Department of Biological Sciences at the University of Pittsburgh. My current goal is to map known functional surface patches of Large T Antigen from oncogenic Simian Virus 40 onto similar proteins across different virus families in an attempt to identify regions of viral proteins with similar functions. 
          </p>

          <p>
            In my free time, I like to hike and explore the country via road trips (pictured above)!
